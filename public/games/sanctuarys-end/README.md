# Sanctuary's End

A fun, vibe-coded, browser-based action-RPG with serious Diablo vibes.

Sanctuary's End is a hack-and-slash ARPG built from a small set of plain static files — an HTML shell, the game script, and lazy-loaded 3D assets — rendered in 3D with Three.js. No build step, no install: roll a hero, dive an endless procedural dungeon, hunt loot, build out your skills, and clear bosses, all in your browser.

## Play it

**Online:** https://j3vb.github.io/Sanctuarys_End/sanctuary.html — just click and play.

**Locally:** the game now loads Three.js as ES modules, so it **must be served over `http://`** — double-clicking `sanctuary.html` (a `file://` URL) will no longer work (browsers block module loads from `file://`). Serve the repo with any static server and open the game over `http://localhost`.

Always use the **same fixed port** (`8000` below) every session. Browser saves (localStorage) are keyed per origin, so `localhost:8000` and `localhost:3000` are *different* save stores — switching ports hides your characters.

```
# from the repo root, pick ONE and stick with port 8000:
python -m http.server 8000
#   or
npx serve . -l 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000/sanctuary.html`. The renderer is WebGPU-first (recent Chromium-based browsers) and falls back to WebGL2 elsewhere; the first load also needs an internet connection for the CDN libraries.

> **Migrating an existing `file://` save?** Saves made by the old double-click build live in the `file://` origin and will *not* appear at `http://localhost:8000`. To carry them over: open your old `file://` build, go to **Settings → Saves → Download** (or **Copy**), then open the new `http://localhost:8000` build, paste/load the file under **Settings → Saves → Import & Reload**.

## Features

- Four classes — Warrior, Mage, Rogue, and Barbarian, each with their own skills and stat growth
- Active skills with rune trees and rank-ups, plus a four-sector passive skill forest
- Deep loot: five rarity tiers, affixes, enchanting, gems, offhands and two-handers across eight gear slots
- Towns and shops — vendors, a smith with targeted crafting, alchemist, enchanter, gambler, jeweler, and a Dust shop
- An endless procedural dungeon ("The Descent") with room-and-door floor layouts and telegraphed bosses every few floors
- An open world of biome-themed regions with hunts and roaming stalkers
- Difficulty tiers from Normal to Inferno — earned by how deep you've descended
- A Journal of achievements, floor bounties, shrines, treasure chests and goblins
- Auto-saving characters with multiple save slots (plus export/import for backups)
- Fully self-hosted (no CDN) — and optional online co-op

## Co-op (optional)

For shared-world play, run the lightweight relay in `Server/server.js` (Node 16+):

```
cd Server
npm install
npm start
```

It defaults to port 8787 — start it, then connect from the in-game Multiplayer menu. Each player's game runs locally; the server just relays presence and chat.

Note: co-op uses a `ws://` (non-TLS) connection, so play from a locally-served `http://` page (see **Play it → Locally**) — browsers block `ws://` from the `https://` hosted page above, and the game can no longer be launched from `file://`. For best results each player serves their own local copy at `http://localhost:8000` (a secure context). For LAN/internet play, share the host's IP + port.

## Learn more

The full game codex lives in `sanctuary_wiki.html` — open it in your browser for searchable, detailed docs on classes, stats, combat formulas, status effects, items and affixes, uniques and sets, the economy, zones, difficulty scaling, monsters, bosses, and the version changelog.

See also [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the release history, and [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for where the game is headed next.

## Development

The game ships as plain static files — there's **no build step**, and nothing below changes how it's
served on GitHub Pages. The game logic is split into ordered classic scripts under `js/` (loaded by
`sanctuary.html` in filename order — the numeric prefix *is* the load order); the tooling is purely a
dev safety net (it runs in your editor and in CI):

```
npm install      # one-time: installs the dev tools (TypeScript + Biome); not shipped to players
npm run check    # type-check + lint + format-check + tests — the same gate CI runs on every PR
```

Individual steps: `npm run typecheck` (TypeScript checks the `js/` scripts via JSDoc + `jsconfig.json`,
no emit — they share one global program), `npm run lint` / `npm run format` (Biome), and `npm test`
(Node's test runner — save/migration + gameplay-logic regression tests in `tests/`, plus HTML and
load-order guards). Type definitions live in `types/` — see [types/README.md](types/README.md).
